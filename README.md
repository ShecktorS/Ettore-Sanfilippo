Hi there! 👋 I'm a pianist with a huge passion for arts, cinema and entertainment. 🎹🎨🎬
After dedicating 15 years to music, I decided to change course and approach front-end development, a field that stimulates and challenges me every day. 💻🚀
I love to express myself creatively and I've always been fascinated by the digital world. I've acquired technical and computer skills that allow me to manage my online and offline activities in the best way. 🌐🔌
Music taught me to think outside the box and find original solutions to problems. 🎼🧠

## What I'm focusing on 🛠
In this period I am dedicating a lot of time to my professional development as a web developer. I have just completed an important intensive course that provided me with the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as teaching me how to use tools like Git and Visual Studio Code. Now I am deepening my studies on two frameworks that are very much in demand in the job market: Bootstrap and Angular. My goal is to become a competent and updated web developer, able to create innovative and quality projects.
